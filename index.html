        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>My name is Princewill Ejimba. I'm from Anambra state, Nigeria. In October 2023, I graduated from the university of lagos with a bachelors of pharmacy.</p>
        <p>I thrive in environments that allow me use my strengths in critical thinking and creativity to solve problems.</p> 
        <p>Despite being in the clinical niche, I have a keen interest in tech and it all started when I got fired sometime in 2022.</p>

        <p>Before considering tech, I was a copywriter where I created sales pages, emails and articles with the aim of achieving a call to action.</p>

        <p>I genuinely eunjoyed this career path because it aligned with my strengths. But everything changed with the advent of ChatGPT. Suddenly, articles that took hours or even days to create could be generated in seconds.</p>

        <p>On one hand, I saw the prospects of how this could make my work easier. But on the flip side, I foresaw a problem that became clearer in a few weeks when my client informed me my services were no longer needed.</p>
       
        <p>I tried getting new clients but client acqusiition was now harder than ever. This whole experience created a passion within me not to only be a tech consumer but a producer as well.</p>
        
        <h4>Why I joined Altschool</h4>
        <p>My reason for joining altschool is to equip myself with the appropriate knowledge and skills to create solutions to problems in the immediate community, state, cuntry and world at large</p>
